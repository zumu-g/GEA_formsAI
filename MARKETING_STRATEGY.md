# Slate — Marketing Strategy

**"Fill forms. Not your calendar."**

---

## Brand Identity

### Brand Name: **Slate**
Clean. Minimal. Evokes a writing surface — a blank slate that gets filled intelligently.

### Brand Personality
- **Confident** — We know this problem and we've solved it
- **Minimal** — Say less, deliver more
- **Trustworthy** — Your data, your forms, your control
- **Effortless** — The product feels like it reads your mind

### Visual Identity
- **Primary Color:** Slate Black (#1D1D1F) — Apple-inspired authority
- **Accent Color:** Electric Indigo (#5856D6) — modern, trustworthy, distinctive
- **Secondary:** Warm Gray (#F5F5F7) — clean backgrounds
- **Typography:** SF Pro Display / Inter — crisp, modern, highly legible
- **Design Language:** Generous whitespace, subtle shadows, glass morphism, fluid animations
- **Logo:** Wordmark "Slate" in custom-weighted Inter, with a minimal abstract "S" icon that suggests layered pages

### Taglines (A/B Test)
1. "Fill forms. Not your calendar." (Primary)
2. "Upload. Map. Done."
3. "Your forms, filled by AI."
4. "Pay per form. Not per month."
5. "The last time you'll fill that form manually."

## Pricing Psychology

### Why Pay-Per-Use Wins for This Market

1. **Loss aversion elimination** — Users never feel they're "wasting" a subscription
2. **Micro-transaction comfort** — $0.25 feels like nothing compared to the time saved
3. **Endowment effect** — Purchased credits feel like "owned value," driving usage
4. **Anchoring** — Compare $0.25/form to $50/month subscription = instant perceived value
5. **Sunk cost utilization** — Bought credits motivate users to keep using the product

### Pricing Communication

**Never say:** "It costs $0.25 per form"
**Always say:** "Fill 200 forms for less than your monthly Netflix"

**Key comparisons to anchor against:**
- "Your time is worth $50/hour. Slate fills a form in 10 seconds for $0.25."
- "Your current tool costs $600/year whether you use it or not. Slate costs $0 when you don't."
- "A 200-credit pack costs less than one hour of an admin's time."

### Upsell Path
```
Free (5 fills) → Starter Pack ($2) → Business Pack ($8.50) → Professional ($28) → Enterprise ($100+)
```

**Key trigger points:**
- Free credits exhausted → prompt Starter pack (low commitment)
- 3rd template created → prompt Business pack (you're a power user)
- Team member invited → prompt Professional pack (team discount)
- API key requested → prompt Enterprise pack (developer needs)
