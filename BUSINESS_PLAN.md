# Slate — Business Plan

**AI-Powered Form Automation Platform**
*A GEA Technologies Subsidiary*

---

## Executive Summary

Slate is an AI-powered form-filling platform that eliminates the repetitive, manual task of completing business forms. Users upload a PDF, map their data once via drag-and-drop, and Slate fills it — instantly, accurately, every time. Built on a **pay-per-use** model (no subscriptions), Slate targets the massive gap between expensive enterprise document automation and doing it by hand.

**The problem is universal:** every business fills out the same forms repeatedly — tax filings, compliance documents, vendor onboarding, insurance claims, permit applications. The current options are: (a) fill them manually every time, (b) pay $50–200/month for bloated subscription software, or (c) hire someone to do it. Slate offers a fourth option: pay only when you fill, starting at $0.25 per form.
